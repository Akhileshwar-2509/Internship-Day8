🔍 Key Insights

📈 Sales Trends Over Time
Sales exhibit a steady upward trend across the months, with noticeable spikes during Q4, suggesting seasonal peaks — possibly due to year-end shopping and promotional offers.

🌎 Regional Performance
The West and East regions lead in total sales, while the Central region lags behind, indicating a potential opportunity to improve sales strategies in underperforming regions.

📦 Category-wise Profitability
While Technology products contribute significantly to overall profits, Furniture shows high sales but relatively low profits — possibly due to discounts or high delivery costs.

👥 Top Performing Customers
A small group of customers contribute to a large portion of sales, highlighting the importance of customer retention strategies and personalized marketing for high-value clients.

🚚 Shipping Mode Impact
Same-Day shipping mode has the lowest usage but results in higher average sales per order, indicating a niche market segment that values speed over cost.

Time series forecasting predicts continued growth in sales over the next 15 days, helping in resource planning and inventory optimization.

🛒 Sub-Category Performance
Sub-categories like Phones and Chairs are top contributors to sales, whereas Tables and Bookcases have lower profit margins, suggesting a need to reassess pricing or marketing strategies for these items.
